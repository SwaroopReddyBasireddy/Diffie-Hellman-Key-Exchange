Use rand = "0.8.5", glass_pumpkin = "1.2.0", num-bigint = { version = "0.4", features = ["rand"] } as dependencies
glass_pumpkin is used for safe primes and num-bigint is used for modular arithmetic.
Key Generation protocol: To generate the public parameters called prime modulus (p) and generator (g)of datatype BigUint which is a member of the module "num_bigint". p is a safe prime such the q = (p-1)/2is also a prime generated from num_bigint::BigUint. The generator g = 2, the random self-reducibility ofthe discrete logarithm problem a small g is equally secure as any other generator of the same group.
